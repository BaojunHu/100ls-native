A modern Typescript utility library both for the browser and for Node.js, that helps you solve routine tasks and common problems in a fast way, therefore letting you focus on what matters (building awesome stuff!)

## Usage

`@dimjs/lang` is exported in both pure ESM formats with `type:module`. This means you can import it with import syntaxes.

## Example

```ts
import { isArray } from '@dimjs/lang'; // shuffles an array
```
